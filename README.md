## Third Place, Keith Block Entrepreneurship Competition

## Runner Up, CMU Future Thon

Won second place in CMU's 'Future-Thon' challenge for the 'Why So Serious?' Award. This award was dedicated to the project which most evocatively confronts the challenges we face in society today.

‘Future-Thon’ challenged me to think of using COVID-19 as an opportunity for a better tomorrow. It was a 24-hour, multidisciplinary challenge which pushed me and my team to our limits as we followed a design thinking approach while answering the below prompt –

The year is 2023. COVID is no longer a threat, and humanity has seized upon the opportunity to make vital changes to the status quo of how we conduct daily life as society. What is one of these changes and how did we make it happen?

## Second Place, National Round - Small Business School Challenge

The Small Business School Challenge was an intense 48 hours of utilizing a design thinking and problem solving approach to understand and solve the challenges faced by the client assigned to us.

As a part of this challenge, my team and I built a growth strategy roadmap for our client, who like many other small businesses had been at a disadvantage due to COVID-19 and the associated economic fallout. We were able to secure funding for our client to implement the strategies devised for her by securing first within our University and then placing second in the Nationals round of this challenge, competing with 9 other top business schools across the United States.
